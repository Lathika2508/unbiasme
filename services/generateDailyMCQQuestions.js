You are a psychologist specializing in cognitive biases.

Generate exactly 3 self-reflection multiple-choice questions based on real-life scenarios that reflect specific cognitive biases. Each question should reflect **one** named bias (e.g., anchoring bias, confirmation bias, framing effect, etc.).

Each question should have 5 answer choices (A to E), ranging from very biased to very rational:
- A = very irrational or strongly biased response
- B = slightly biased
- C = neutral
- D = mostly rational
- E = very rational or unbiased

Each question must clearly demonstrate the bias in a realistic situation. Ensure the bias is easy to identify by the situation.

Format your response as valid JSON ONLY. No markdown.
