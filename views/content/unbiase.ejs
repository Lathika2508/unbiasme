              Understanding the Big Five Personality Traits
            </h2>
            <p>
              Our quiz is based on the Big Five Personality Model, a widely
              accepted framework in psychology. It includes five major
              personality traits:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Openness to Experience ‚Äì Your curiosity, imagination, and love
                for new ideas.
              </li>
              <li>
                Conscientiousness ‚Äì Your organization, discipline, and
                goal-oriented behavior.
              </li>
              <li>
                Extraversion ‚Äì Your sociability, energy, and assertiveness.
              </li>
              <li>
                Agreeableness ‚Äì Your kindness, empathy, and cooperation with
                others.
              </li>
              <li>
                Neuroticism ‚Äì Your tendency to experience stress, anxiety, or
                emotional ups and downs.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h2 id="Scenario-Based">Scenario-Based Questions</h2>
            <p>
              You won‚Äôt find generic personality test questions here. Instead,
              we use real-life scenarios that reflect how you might react in
              everyday situations
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Each scenario gives you six statements (e.g., how you might
                think or feel in that situation).
              </li>
              <li>
                You rate how well each one describes you on a scale from 1 (Not
                Like Me) to 5 (Very Much Like Me).
              </li>
              <li>Each statement corresponds to one of the Big Five traits.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- //// -->
            <h2 id="Scoring ">Scoring and Trait Analysis</h2>
            <p>Once you complete all the scenarios</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Your responses are grouped by trait.</li>
              <li>
                We calculate a score for each trait based on how you responded
                to all related questions.
              </li>
              <li>
                These scores tell us how high or low you fall on each of the Big
                Five traits.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="Interpretation ">Personalized Interpretation</h2>
            <p>
              Using your trait scores, we generate a custom personality report
              that explains:
            </p>
            <li>What each trait means in your life.</li>
            <li>How your specific combination of traits makes you unique.</li>
            <p>
              We explain it in natural language‚Äîclear, friendly, and easy to
              understand.
            </p>
            <p>For example:</p>

            <p>
              Your personality traits influence how you interpret the world, and
              that affects the cognitive biases you're more likely to have.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                High Openness might make you prone to confirmation bias, because
                you love exploring new ideas and might focus more on evidence
                that fits your worldview.
              </li>
              <li>
                Low Conscientiousness might relate to planning fallacy, because
                you underestimate how long tasks take.
              </li>
